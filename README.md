# Image Stitching 

## Description

This project stitches multiple images together to create a panoramic image(orthomosaic). The script loads all images from a specified folder, stitches them together using OpenCV's `Stitcher` class, and saves the resulting panoramic image.

## Features

- Load images from a specified folder.
- Stitch images to create a panoramic view.
- Save and display the resulting stitched image.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-stitching.git
    cd image-stitching
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Stitch Images

1. Place your images in a folder, e.g., `home`.
2. Modify the notebook  to point to your image folder:
    ```python
    image_folder = r'C:/Users/rajuv/Desktop/home'
    ```
3. Run the notebook.

4. The resulting stitched image will be saved as `stitched_image.jpg` in the current working directory and displayed using `matplotlib`.
